[00:14.43] Amidst the passing of time
[00:18.31] I remember you
[00:22.47] The two reflected in the screen, gazing pensively
[00:27.69] was laughing
[00:30.19] I don't want to know
[00:29.29] 
[00:31.19] Knowing too much
[00:32.73] I was swallowed up by the days that simply passed by.
[00:36.63] Still, I just want to see you one more time
[00:45.13] I nodded and believed your words
[00:43.58] 
[00:48.15] Time passes, leaving one behind
[00:51.64] What should have been visible
[00:53.40] The future slipped through my fingers.
[00:58.19] Fragments of days that cannot return
[01:01.12] Your presence
[01:03.08] I still find myself searching for it.
[01:05.85] I'm still reaching out to the two of us from that day
[01:13.85] 
[01:25.42] I drew the line myself.
[01:27.11] I pretended not to see "reality."
[01:29.32] That's me
[01:30.99] I can't see it, I can't see it
[01:32.87] Blooming beyond the border
[01:34.75] vivid flowers
[01:36.44] I could actually see it
[01:40.94] Without realizing it
[01:39.61] 
[01:41.95] I locked the door of my worn-out heart
[01:47.10] There is nothing but beauty
[01:50.68] I was the only one left behind.
[01:54.46] The sky was so blue it stung the back of my eyes.
[01:57.98] I'm going back to retrieve the scenery of that day
[02:01.84] You told me you liked me
[02:09.84] Without showing it to anyone
[02:08.68] 
[02:10.52] The feelings I hid with these hands
[02:13.46] It still lives within me
[02:16.66] Close your eyes and see
[02:18.61] The vividly resurgent scenery even now
[02:24.11] Fragments of days that cannot return
[02:23.35] 
[02:26.35] What was projected was
[02:28.14] A future locked away as a bud
[02:31.49] Redraw
[02:35.49] Your words that day and
[02:34.44] 
[02:37.29] Beautiful moments and
[02:39.13] The scenery we shared together
[02:42.54] Forgotten feelings and
[02:44.48] Weaving together the future we thought was lost
[02:48.85] I'll keep walking through days that can never return
[02:53.73] Even without you from now on
[02:57.13] If I could wave to the two of us from that day
[03:01.28] It has indeed started moving.
[03:04.25] To the Future
